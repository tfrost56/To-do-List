# To-do-List

This project was built as part of Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course.

As the name suggests, this is a simple to do list application built with HTML, CSS & Javascript. The application allows you to add new tasks, cross of completed tasks and delete them permantly if you wish. The Plus icon can minimise the look when your not adding new tasks.
